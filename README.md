This project aims to predict Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) using machine learning techniques and decision tree algorithms. The goal is to identify individuals at risk for CKD by analyzing patient data and medical information.

The decision tree algorithm, a type of machine learning, is used to model decisions and their potential outcomes. By training a decision tree algorithm on a dataset of patient information, it can predict the likelihood of an individual developing CKD based on their characteristics and medical history.

The project includes the following steps:

-> Data pre-processing and cleaning

-> Feature selection and engineering

-> Model training and evaluation

-> Model deployment and integration (Using Streamlit)

The project is implemented using Python and relevant libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy. The dataset used for training and testing is available in the repository. The trained model can be used for making predictions on new patient data and for identifying patients at risk for CKD. This can be useful in implementing early interventions to prevent or slow the progression of the disease.
